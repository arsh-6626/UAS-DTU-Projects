# DARPA PHASE 2 TEAM MEET


## First Years Agenda
* **READ THE DARPA PDFs**
* Registration this week
* Prepare a resume this week and submit for reg
* Need to sign an agreement
* DARPA data isn't meant to be shared outside the team
* LAST ONLINE MEET

### Old systems
Camera noIR, PiCAM *earlier
FC + OBC Echopilot Orin + Pi for PiCAM

### camera requirement:
* orthogonally projecting
* no fisheye even removal causes loss of view and data
* rolling shutter not preffered *gives a skewed view on unstable platforms
* global shutter preffered

### Teleoperation 	
* manual control of the systems, was allowed in the first phase
* manual triggers weren't allowed for code execution
* we were only allowed to run the ugv around
		

### Software codestack 	
*April Tag present near casualty
			*casualty marked with id
			*codewise autonomous systems + UGV were driven by pilots
			

### Major Challenge in 2nd phase  
* Teleoperation is prohibited, systems must be totally autonomous (the whole swarm of systems )

### Depthcam 
* depth estimation using 2-3 cameras ( question in entrance test )
* works on RGB data
* d455 depthcam
* software will use it as RGB cam ( because NDAA compliant )
* Trauma, Motion and everything else

### LIDAR 	
* more accurate and higher range
* will even work in low visiblity conditions like fog, etc.

### RADAR 
* respiratory rate reading

### Mic 
* Vocal alertness


## Personal Guidelines 
* Roles of staging area 
* Last time team of 8 people 6 were allowed in staging area
* This time team of x people 5 are allowed in staging area + 4 safety officers allowed
* we have to have a separate GCS ( Ground Control System ) for UGVs and UAVs


## NDAA Compliance
* National Defence Authorisation Act
* Non covered Countries - items allowed ( anywhere except Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, etc. )
* but NDAA compliant - they must have purchased certification
* a NDAA compliant system can only receive info from another NDAA compliant system
* if we want to send information we will need a NDAA compliant GCS

## System Compliance 
### older
* 1.5 m distance maintain from casualty
### new
* 2m distance maintain from casualty
### miscellanous
* UAV preferred to be in 5kg category only
* "kisi bhi competition me sabse chutiya cheez COMMS hoti hai " - Chirag Sir, 31/12/2024, 12:18 pm
* no external lighting allowed in night courses


## E-STOPS 
* Emergency Stops
* whenever system goes rogue (unsafe) - these are checks to ensure that system runs safely
* need to recover 20 sec something issue ( said by nishant sir ) 
### T1 - Wireless ESTOP
* stop their or RTL at that
### T2 - Recovery ESTOP
* mandatory on 10+ kg systems
* triggered goes back
### T3 - On platform estop
* mushroom shaped button on UGV, as soon as we push that it must stop


## What's New
* No apron tags  -  we need lat and long latitude reporting by ourself
* if we dont repair lat and long - then we are DQed
* Earlier static golden window, this time its dynamic for each system

## Points
* single casulaty report - earns upto 25 points
* 5 bonus points if **golden window**
* Golden Window - Haemmoraheage, Vitals, Respiratory Distress

* Reassesment occurs
* Only a small section allows reassassement point

## System Narrative Description
* read from pdf

* new videos need to be uploaded for night flights rest older ones will suffice

## Mobility 
* autonomity for traversing 15 m distance
* min 2 90 degree turns required

## Night operation
* nighttime flight takeoff and landing with use of collision lighting

## Team comm plan
* inter dept meets start, where each dept reports their progress to each other
